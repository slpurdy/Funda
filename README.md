1. Provide Big O Notation for each of your solutions.
-Insert is 0(1) because the array which means it takes constant time regardless of the size of the array.

-Reverse is Î˜(n) because even though its an array, the number of operations needed to complete the reversal increases with the size of the array.



2. Research Quick, Bubble and Insertion sort. Describe which algorithm and how they perform.

-Quick: Divides the array into roughly equal halves.

-Bubble: Loops through the array repeatedly, comparing adjacent pairs of elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Repeat until the array is fully sorted.

-Insertion sort: performs by moving an object 1 positon. Inserts each new element into its correct position until the array is fully sorted.



3. Research Dijkstra's Algorthim. Describe what problem this algorithm solves and list 2 situations, datasets, or real world applications that the algorithm can be used to solve.

-Dijkstra's algorithm solves the shortest-path problem. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. 

-This algorithm could be used for GPS for appliactions like Door Dash to find the shortest fastet route from food place to customers for Dashers. 

-This algorithm could also be used for internet routing. It can find the shortest path between servers, enabling faster and reliable communication in computer networks and the internet.
